# Core-SQL
Description

A day-by-day structured deep dive into the basics of SQL. Complete lessons, and read tutorials.

This goal makes heavy use of external resources: the Introduction to SQL course on Khan Academy, Tutorial’s Point, SQL Zoo and SQL Bolt

For the first few days, you’ll be working on existing courses and completing tutorials. Then you’ll use your skills to complete a set of SQL exercises and submit your queries as your artifact.

Fork the sql-exercises repo, and use the fork as your artifact. Complete all the exercises without looking at solutions on the internet.

Context

In order to build web applications, it’s important to get a solid grounding into the basics of SQL. Proficiency in SQL is a core skill needed to build the backend.

Becoming a full stack web developer means that you need to be comfortable with writing SQL queries and understanding relational database design.
